# C++ Best Practices

This organization exists to provide additional documentation and supporting tools that reflect the guidelines in [Jason Turner](@lefticus)'s [C++ Best Practices](https://leanpub.com/cppbestpractices/) book.

## Templates

There are a handful of C++ github project templates to explore. Each have extensive CI, static, and runtime analysis preconfigured. The names and list are currently in flux.

## Game Jam

The C++ Best Practices organization is also used to host a [Game Jam](https://github.com/cpp-best-practices/game_jam) (first held in April 2022). This Game Jam is unique in that code quality is one of the primary ways that your game is judged, and a [starter template](https://github.com/cpp-best-practices/ftxui_template) is provided.
